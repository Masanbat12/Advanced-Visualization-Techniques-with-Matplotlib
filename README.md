# Generating-and-Visualizing-plot
 This project generating two types of plots using the Matplotlib library in Python. 
 The first part of the code demonstrates how to plot a simple line graph of square numbers. 
 The second part introduces a class named RandomWalk that generates random walks and visualizes them using a scatter plot.


Generating and Visualizing Random Walks
The RandomWalk class generates random walks. A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, each of which is left up to chance.

To visualize a random walk, make sure to include the RandomWalk class in your script. After initializing an instance of RandomWalk, call the fill_walk() method to generate the points of the walk. Then, use Matplotlib to create a scatter plot of these points.

## Dependencies:
Python3
Matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
